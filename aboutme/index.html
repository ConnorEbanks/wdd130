    <p>
      Hey all! My name is Connor Ebanks. I am majoring in Software Development
      and hope to get my masters in Cyber Security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my hobbies include golf, disc golf, hiking, gaming, and hanging
      out with my wife. I have been married for 3 years and we currently do not
      have any kids, just a dog named Reks! I love all things technology and am
      so excited to be able to go to school online to hopefully start a career
      in Software Development/Cyber Security.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a member of the church my whole life and love hearing peoples
      conversion/come to Jesus stories! I love that each one of us has a story,
      but the thing we all can relate to and conversate about is Jesus and his
      teachings!
